      "  It seems recently 1820 was registered in some new states including Kentucky (KY) where we have the tax issue with Bluestar. Can you please help find who did the registration and what was the business requirement to have them registered in July when they were not registered since many years. \n",
      "  Lets touch base back when you are able to get some clues and figure out the tax process in Vertex. \n",
      "Please refer to our discussion and conclusions we had in October last year. Attached email chain.\n",
      "What we discussed last year was that order can only be tax exempt (whether direct or channel) if its marked as non taxable (tax code = 0) in SAP or has an exemption certificate. You seemed to be fine with any of these options you prefer until you get exemption certificates from all Resellers.\n",
      "The reason we see Blue-star collect tax all of sudden was the registration of 1820 in Kentucky in Vertex in July and we fixed this by making Bluestar non taxable in SAP with tax code 0.\n",
      "What we would like to know is how and when 1820 was registered in some of the new states in Vertex so we can take a reference for future issues of other states/customers.\n",
      " BlueStar is a distributor and all orders through them are channel orders.\n",
      " The system should only be charging tax on Direct orders. \n",

      "We have been able to identify the cause of taxes on Bluestar Inc from 07/12 onwards. Its not SAP but Vertex that had some data changes.\n",
      "Bluestar belongs to Kentucky state and 1820 was never registered in Kentucky before 07.11 so the orders never had any taxes calculated even though Kentucky has been set up a Taxable State for most product Categories.\n",
      "On 07.11 Someone from our side (Ivanti) registered 1820 in Kentucky(this was pointed out by Vertex Consultants) and after that, all orders are calculating taxes whether Channel or Direct. We dont have a mechanism to differentiate the channel vs direct orders in Vertex.\n",
      "Along with Kentucky, I found 6 other states were registered in 1820 in July - Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Nevada, Oklahoma and Rhode Island.\n",
      " Can we find who could have done this and what was the business requirement for registering 1820 in new states.\n",
      " Can Kentucky be reversed to the same status before 07.11 so the taxability remains the same for BlueStar?\n",
      " If the registration was required and cannot be changed, then can we change the Kentucky to non taxable status like many other states for the category \"Canned Software\"\n",

      "Since we could not find any thing that changed for Bluestar in SAP or Vertex, we have decided to change the tax code on the customer 65193 Bluestar Inc to 0.\n",
      "This will make it tax exempt. The problem though would be that the orders on Bluestar will now be tax exempt even if its direct. (not going though a channel).\n",
      "Bluestar has now been made tax exempt in production and starting today, you should not see any taxes charged for this customer.\n",
      "Please let us know if this solution works for you. I will close the incident.\n",
      "This is not a tax exempt account. This is a Channel order that we never collect tax on. There should be no need for a tax exempt certificate because we don’t collect taxes on Channel orders, only direct order. We have never in the past or currently needed to do anything tax related with a Channel order. There is nothing in Vertex, nor has there ever been anything in Vertex for BlueStar.\n",
      "SAP just started calculating tax for all Channel orders with BlueStar. This is the only Channel order this is happening on.\n",
      "We did look in and out of SAP and Vertex to see any recent change for the BlueStar partner 65193 or its end customers. Seems like the exempt certificate might have been expired or deleted.\n",
      "While we have raised this with Vertex and Syed is working on providing them with more info to identify the root cause, the immediate solution for now to keep our business going is to maintain an exemption certificate on Bluestar so that we can continue processing orders with tax exemption.\n",
      "We can reissue the faulty order again after putting an exemption certificate to remove the taxes and fix the orders unless. We will have to cancel and issue new invoices if those needs to be corrected as well.\n",
      "Please see attached file with list of orders for customer Bluestar Inc since last couple months. \n",

Your company has a personal Webex Microsite that is set up on your end. We support the webex site, but you actually set up the webex session and start the webex recording.

      "Hi All, It’s performance review time! Please log in to our new review system, Reflektive, and complete your self-review by Friday, May 20th. Your manager will also be completing their review of your prior year’s performance and then scheduling conversations during the month of June. Key Notes: • Employees hired prior to January 1, 2016 will complete an annual review at this time. After this look-back performance review, we will move to a more progressive, ongoing performance management model with regular goal-setting and check-ins between managers and employees that are tracked through the Reflektive system. • Once you complete the self-review, your manager gets an email notification. You may edit your review up until the May 20 deadline. If edits are made after completion, your manager is again notified via email. • You will see a “Goals” tab in the Reflektive module; it is not required to complete goals during the current review period, but you are welcome to start utilizing this area if you wish. After we get through this annual performance and merit review cycle, more detail on goal-setting and the ongoing performance management process will be outlined in early Q3 for adoption going forward. • Performance reviews will be closely followed by merit reviews. Applicable merit increases will be communicated in July (effective dates of the merit increase will be July 4th for North America and July first for international). To complete your self-review: • Visit https://www.reflektive.com/app • Enter your email address in the \"Email\" field – if autocomplete populates your email, make sure your cursor is at the end of your email address • A \"Log in with Single Sign-on\" button should appear.

The \\content-management$ share will have to be replicated to a file server in UT prior to the bulk move so you can maintain daily access.   Basically the netapp-spa/spb being the core backend storage is where the bulk of all AZ data resides, This is the bulk device IT intends to move ~week 15 Jan. Any required virtual servers and/or file shares residing on the backend storage will need to be replicated and cutover prior to 15Jan to ensure accessibility through the move.

WE may just want to do this for the one hostname (novell.cdn.heatsoftware.com) to start; and enable the rest if we don’t have any issues – for example.

      " Set the Opportunity Stage to “6. Contract” and the Forecast Status to “5. Pending – Finance/Ops”. This will trigger a notification to the Order Admin team to process the sales order in NetSuite.”\n",
      " At the moment I believe this notification is sent to individual members of the team so I will get am email as well as Kirsty and Lindsay etc. Is it possible to have these notifications go to a central mailbox such as Orders UK and Orders DE? This will make it much more manageable when there are large volumes to invoice.\n",
      " 2. Once the invoice has been issued, the renewals team have the following instruction on checking whether an order has been invoiced:\n",
      " “To check on the progress of the sales order to invoice, Renewals Team will go to the Sales Order subsection of the Opportunity and look at the Status. When invoiced, the status will be Billed”\n",
      " There is concern that this is not ideal as will be a lengthy process on checking every sales order, possibly more than once, to check if an order has been invoiced. Is it possible to have members of the renewals team CC’d on any delivery notes which are sent out on invoice? I assume it would be all renewals team members or none and we cannot do it based on who’s account it is?\n",

      " 10 Bulletins Address 5 Active Exploits in October Patch Tuesday \n",
      "Cyber criminals have plenty of opportunity this month with 5 vulnerabilities now under active exploit, 2 of which are shared. Microsoft has released 10 bulletins this October Patch Tuesday to address those and other vulnerabilities found in both current and old code. Quick response will be of particular importance this month.\n",
      "As is often the case, we will start with the browsers. First on your list of priorities should be MS16-119, a critical update for Edge. Addressing 13 CVEs, this bulletin includes an active exploit against CVE-2016-7189 allowing remote code execution which could result in deep compromise of your system. Next up is MS16-118 a cumulative, critical update for IE but with many shared Edge vulnerabilities. CVE-2016-3298 is under active exploit for both the latest and older IE releases. This is another large bulletin with 11 CVEs addressed.\n",
      "Next on your list of priorities for October should be MS16-120 which is for vulnerabilities found in older versions of Microsoft Graphics Component. This is a critical update for vulnerabilities found in Windows, .NET, Office, Skype for Business, Silverlight and Lync. Of the seven total CVEs addressed in this bulletin, one is under active exploit, CVE-2016-3393.\n",
      "MS16-122 is the last of the Microsoft critical bulletins however user interaction is required for an attacker to be successful. It resolves a vulnerability in Windows which could allow a remote code execution if Video Control fails to handle objects in memory correctly.\n",
      "We also have another update for Adobe Flash Player, MS16-127. This critical bulletin resolves vulnerabilities described in APSB16-32 and found in Flash Player when installed on Windows 8.1, Server 2012, RT 8.1 and Windows 10.\n",
      "MS16-121 is a bulletin rated important for most versions of Office that patches a RTF remote code execution vulnerability. While the bulletin is only rated important, CVE-2016-7193 is being exploited now. MS16-126, though rated only as moderate, is also under active exploit. This security update addresses an information disclosure issue in Internet Messaging API that could allow an attacker to test for the presence of files on disk.\n",
      "Lastly, Microsoft announced more details around its new cumulative patch update model which were first disclosed last month on Technet. The new patch strategy is a single monthly rollup designed to streamline patches and provide you with easier, more consistent patching. HEAT Software products support this new model and the first set of security and cumulative updates now appear in the various patch feeds. Pay special attention to the names of the new patches and be sure to read up on the topic from their latest blog post.\n",
      "Here are the complete details on what was updated outside of Microsoft since the beginning of the previous month: \n",
      " Simple 3rd party patching for users of Microsoft System Center\n",
      " You can't defend against the threats you're not aware of\n",
      "HEAT Software is always adding new products to our 3rd party Windows application coverage. If there are any third-party products you’d like to have added, please let us know.\n",

      "Today I am announcing some very important and exciting news as we take another major step forward in pursuing our mission to become the worldwide leading provider of Hybrid Service Management & Unified Endpoint Management software solutions\n",
      "Backed by Clearlake Capital, we have signed a definitive agreement to acquire the Absolute Manage and Absolute Service divisions from publicly traded company Absolute Software. I expect the transaction to close in early October.\n",
      "There is a well thought through strategic rationale for this acquisition, and I want to take a moment here to explain why this makes sense for us:\n",
      "    Similar to our own HEAT Client Management offering, Absolute Manage is an integrated, best-in-class Client and Enterprise Mobility Management software solution. With Absolute Manage organizations can manage and secure all of their mobile and endpoint devices from a single console, including PCs, Macs, iOS, Android and Windows mobile devices. Unlike our current offering, Absolute Manage has very strong coverage across Apple computers and is recognized by Gartner for having the best Mac management capabilities among client management products that provide both Windows and Mac management. The solution has an established following in the Mac community and is one of only two management solutions endorsed by Apple to manage Mac environments. As such we will significantly extend our breadth and depth of device coverage and offer the most comprehensive management capabilities in the industry.As most of you may know, today we OEM our EMM offering from a partner, but Absolute Manage also incorporates a complete EMM solution for smartphones and tablets running on either an iOS, Android, or Windows mobile operating system. We will now directly enable IT organizations to remotely manage and secure their mobile devices deployed across the extended enterprise, including employee-owned devices. EMM capabilities of the solution include mobile device management (MDM), mobile application management (MAM), mobile content management (MCM), security enforcement, change and configuration management, asset inventory, and BYOD management. Directly owning this IP will allow us to more aggressively address the increasing number of customers who want to manage all of their endpoints from a single integrated console.While we have done an excellent job with Gartner improving our position on the Client Management Magic Quadrant, we continue to receive feedback from them that we are “too European-centric.” Absolute Manage was formerly an independent company called LANrev and in their various guises have been a provider of client management solutions for over 10 years. Currently they are placed in the Visionary Quadrant of the MQ. Along the way they have an accumulated a client base of approximately 1,011 customers and of these about 650 are based in North America, which immediately gives us critical mass in the US and a solid platform upon which we can build a growing endpoint management business in the world’s largest market. Absolute Manage has an additional 290 customers in EMEA and the balance in APAC, but collectively we accelerate our market share position and become the defatco-standard for customers who require management across PC’s and Mac’s.Like us Absolute Software believes in the value of integrating endpoint management with ITSM and in November 2012, they acquired LiveTime Software, a provider of ITSM and Help Desk solutions. This application subsequently became Absolute Service and the second of the divisions we are acquiring. While smaller than the Absolute Manage division, we add 118 new service management customers to our portfolio, 77 of which are in the US. With the ITSM market still overly fragmented, we therefore start the process of forcing market consolidation and while HEAT Software on a standalone basis today is the 5th largest player world-wide in service management, we have a goal to be in the top 3. Together with our own organic growth, the addition of Absolute Service moves us closer to that goal.  \n",
      "As with the Lumension merger, we will follow a very disciplined process with regards to the integration activities and Ann Haehn will again act as head of the integration office. As is normal, there will be many, many questions about this acquisition and so we have attempted in the attached employee Q&A to address those that are likely top-of-mind. With that said, please be patient as we commence integration planning and know that we will communicate quickly and often to keep you updated. Also attached is a copy of the press release posted on the business wire before market opening today.\n",
      "Today, is another exciting day to be part of HEAT Software and I am proud of the excellent progress we are making. I will discuss more about this acquisition at a Company all-hands meeting which is being scheduled for Thursday September 24th at 8am PST.\n",

      "Hello, DL and mailbox cannot be the same name as I explained in the beginning. See highlighted section down below.\n",
      "Please add that access for Pam to send on behalf of the email box – should be setup similar to the AP NA email box.\n",
      "Also, just to clarify – separately there is a distribution list email setup with the same name. So, if someone were to email the DL then the email box is one of many that are to receive that email\n",
      "Orders@HEATsoftware.com (this is an email collection box, owned by Pam & Susan, if you can’t use the same name – then use “Order@HEATsoftware.com”)\n",
      "First off, yes it’s a collection mailbox per Susan’s request that you and Susan have full access to since its creation. Please scroll down a little in this email chain and see the highlighted section which explains what it is for. I can also send you a cheat sheet if you need help with adding another mailbox in your Outlook for monitoring.\n",
      "Secondly, Susan’s original request did not request Send on behalf of or Send as permissions for you, so you were not given permission to send on behalf of Orders Absolute mailbox from there; it’s just like another user’s mailbox. If you need that permission, then please file a new incident per Susan’s approval.\n",
      "When I tried to respond from that email I got a bounce back. See error below.\n",
      " You can't send a message on behalf of this user unless you have permission to do so. Please make sure you're sending on behalf of the correct sender, or request the necessary permission. If the problem continues, please contact your helpdesk.\n",
      " You can't send a message on behalf of this user unless you have permission to do so. Please make sure you're sending on behalf of the correct sender, or request the necessary permission. If the problem continues, please contact your helpdesk.\n",
      "Can you help me to understand this mail box? I had thought we were going to have this address go directly to my inbox (pam.fitz@heatsoftware.com) but it is a separate in box that I need to monitor.\n",
      "The collection mailbox, Orders Absolute, is created. It is a member of the new DL, _Orders, as requested.\n",
      "Susan and Pam, you have full access permission to the mailbox. Please allow 24 hrs for Active Directory and Exchange to populate it globally in GAL so you can add it into your Outlook for monitoring purpose.\n",
      "The DL, _Orders, is created and I will send a test email to inform all its members and let them know that Susan is the manager who can add/remove its members using Outlook.\n",
      "For the mailbox, if I interpret your request correctly, it will be used as a collection mailbox for internal use by Susan and Pam only and it has to be a member of this new DL. So, to comply with our naming convention and to avoid any confusion down the road, I’d propose: Orders Absolute with email address orders.absolute@HEATsoftware.com, and Susan and Pam will be given full access permission to it for monitoring purpose.\n",
      "I am fine with you using the email box name I provided – just drop the “s”. Order@HEATsoftware.com\n",
      "Thanks James. I completely understand the issue with the consultants and that’s why I mentioned you can ignore them on the DL for the time being. Also, thanks for the explanation about the naming convention for the DL & mailbox. I’ll let Susan chime in if she has a preference for the mailbox name, as even Orders vs. Order might cause some confusion going forward.\n",
      "I am going to create the DL per Susan and Brendan’s urgent request below. Its display name will be _Orders in Outlook GAL with email address Orders@HEATsoftware.com, which they already published to Absolute. Please let me know immediately if you have any concerns.\n",
      "Using the same name and address for a DL and a mailbox is very confusing, and technically it is not feasible. Also, for the two strong-bridge consultants, they cannot be added to the new DL until Troy creates Contacts for them in Exchange. \n",
      "Susan submitted incident 11375 on Friday for a new DL & mailbox to be created to assist the ongoing Absolute integration. The information can be found in this email, but Susan is looking for a DL to be created for Orders@HEATsoftware.com. The list of folks that should be added to the DL is below. You can probably ignore the two strong-bridge consultants for the time being until AD accounts have been setup for them. This is an urgent request as Absolute will start forwarding orders to this DL immediately. If you could please prioritize this and create it Monday morning that would be great. \n",
      "In addition, as part of the same ticket Susan wants a new mailbox created for her and Pam Fitz to monitor. If possible, she’d like the mailbox to have the same name as the DL. If that’s not possible she requested using Order@HEATsoftware.com. This request is not as urgent as the DL one. \n",
      "Can you please let us know once the DL has been created? If you have any questions about the setup or resources that need to be included please reach out to Susan.\n",
      "Kasey & Brendan – please confirm this email dl got setup per below. Glen at Absolute might have communicated already to trading partners.\n",
      "Pam – I realize you are still working with Glen on the remaining order release process. Please provide to him the yellow highlighted DL name that he can use in his trading partner notices, so he will release the orders to us.\n",
      "Brendan - Please use Orders@HEATsoftware.com as the name of the email that would be listed in the Absolute customer facing documents that Absolute will use today to communicate with their trading partners that have sent orders in to Absolute Software, that their order is being redirected to HEAT software. \n",
      "Catherine – would questions from Partners also go to Orders@HEATsoftware, or do you have a DL for Channel questions from Absolute Partners setup?\n",
      "Orders@HEATsoftware.com (this is an email collection box, owned by Pam & Susan, if you can’t use the same name – then use “Order@HEATsoftware.com”)\n",
      "We could probably just create the mailbox and have it auto forward to an existing DL. How does OrderProcessing@heatsoftware.com sound for the mailbox? Let me know if there’s an existing DL we can use for the forward.\n",
      "I'd like to still have a central spot. What if you have a d.l. that includes the order box. That has both features.\n",
      "We do currently Distro list’s noe for our team (licensing, Deal Desk) maybe that is the route we go on this one as well. Different addresses can be added and deleted as needed from that distro list down the road.\n",
      "Do you really want an additional mailbox created that you have to continually check on to see if orders were sent over? Or would you prefer we just use a distribution list so that emails go directly to your normal FRS mailbox? If there’s an existing DL you’re already using for order processing maybe we can just use that? If you truly need a new mailbox or DL created just let me know. I would need the name of it and the folks who should have access to it.\n",
      "Pam Fitz, our HEAT Sales Order Entry Manager, has had several meetings with the Absolute team about their process to expedite the processing of sales orders & invoices. She has been working tirelessly and doing an amazing job managing this process. \n",
      "She was training today with a live order from the Absolute order entry team as they were walking her through the process to generate license keys. Pam is rationalizing the SKUs to the HEAT process, and with the NetSuite consultant’s support this past week, those two are getting ready to load the SKUs into production, manually enter the reseller/end user customer record to process the order to invoice through NetSuite. There are still a few questions & requests that must be cleared first before those invoices can be sent out to the first Absolute customer:\n",
      "1) Absolute has been collecting orders for AS/AM/AM MDM since 6pm 10/2/15. They have approx. 30 orders they are ready to forward to us. The manager of order entry, Glen, said he is going to start forwarding the customer order and accompanying PO to Pam. We would like him to forward to a collection email box, can we get that setup by tomorrow am and can you provide to us what you’d like to name that email box– since this will be new customer/channel partner facing. (I believe that Absolute’s collection email box was called “OrderManagement” or something to that effect. Please provide the new email box name by tomorrow am. I am not totally tied to this solution, but like the idea of having something simple that external parties can email to a single collection spot. Pam would control that email box for data integrity and at the time being be the only one that can access it. Please work with me if you have questions on this.\n",
      "2) Absolute Order Entry team said there are about 15 active resellers that deal with several end customers. He said he will send us basic customer record info on those 15-20 active resellers tomorrow, so Pam and team can start working on these to enter to Netsuite.\n",
      "3) Glen is going to be sending a message to each customer/channel partner at the time he forwards the orders to Pam/new email box and let them know that their order will be serviced by HEAT going forward and we want to provide contact information for key areas – new orders, general questions, support, existing order questions, etc. Glen agreed that he can include our contact info – so we need to provide to him tomorrow am, as he was planning to start this tonight. But, we asked him to wait till tomorrow to coordinate on his communication letter.\n",
      "4) Also, Pam has an Absolute “Welcome” email that is sent to the customer along with the license key. She said it will be discussed in tomorrow’s Absolute product marketing meeting that needs to be updated for Heat. She will need something for tomorrow if possible so Pam can get the first few orders invoiced.\n",
      "5) To include with the invoice itself – a letter to customer or directly on the Absolute invoice itself – some kind of communication that explains why the invoice looks different, providing our vendor information to them, key contact info (support, questions, new orders, payments in USD, etc.).\n",
      "6) Not sure yet of the extent – but most likely many of the invoices were billed in foreign currency, we should know more once we receive the actual invoice data from Absolute. HEAT US policy is that we bill in USD.\n",
      "7) Question to Adrian mostly, or anyone else that might have read the agreements, are the POs from the Resellers (90% of the sales come from resellers, so the 10% direct customer is dotted in there) that Absolute is forwarding to us, is addressed to Absolute Software. Question is are all / some of the reseller/customer contracts assignable? We will need to get the agreements owned by heat as this will impact our rev rec. We can bill the customers, but that doesn’t mean we can recognize the revenue if we don’t have legal contracts in place.\n",
      "Also, please help me welcome our newest member to the Absolute IP integration Project - Mary Lane. She is joining the Absolute integration effort as Project Manager. You can look forward to project meetings she will setup to help get us all on the same page and to support us to a successful integration of Absolute products into the HEAT product family. \n",

      "For the Win7 machine, I had the “Devices” listing, but selecting a device didn’t make it accessible on the machine. I removed the LES client first, then tried uninstalling and reinstalling the VDA on the VM (as a Citrix forum post suggested) via RDP (NOT ICA). I got as far as the uninstall.

      "Here is the direction Ulrike and I would propose for authentication and authorization.\n",
      "We should have a WebEx early in January to discuss these and also how to proceed with the different role models.\n",
      "Since the user logged in into HEAT is already authenticated by HEAT, we don’t think we need to authenticate him again when a request is sent from HEAT to DSM.\n",
      "Instead we think it is necessary to authenticate the HEAT tenant. When DSM receives a request it has to make sure the sender is really the tenant it pretends to be.\n",
      "To achieve this we would propose to have a Public-Private-Key-Pair. HEAT would have to sign the messages with the private key and DSM would have to verify the signature with the public key. If the signature is valid DSM knows that the sender is the owner of the private key, this means the tenant is authenticated.\n",
      "So the customers need to be able to create their own key pair in HEAT: the private key will be stored in HEAT, the public key will be stored in DSM. Every request message needs to be signed and DSM will accept only valid request.\n",
      "As Vince mentioned, DSM should be the system where the authorization for any action against DSM should be managed. The user logged in into HEAT should be passed to DSM and act with the permissions defined in DSM for this user.\n",
      "As of today the DSM Integration in HSM uses just one user which is stored in the HEAT configuration. So every HEAT user is acting with the permissions of this configured user. \n",
      "This need to be changed, so that the logged in HEAT user is authorized according to its own permissions in DSM.\n",
      "If the logged in user is a Windows account, the SID of this user will be used to identify him on the DSM side.\n",
      "If the user is not a Windows account, the user will be identified by its name when executing the first request against DSM and DSM will return a unique ID which should be stored in HEAT as a property of that user and used for all subsequent requests.\n",
      "Let me know if you have any feedback or concerns,\n",
      "Last week we were still busy with the new DSM Release we published on Wednesday, but I plan to make some progress here this week.\n",
      "Jeon-Bok (JB) told me, he was visiting you last week, I hope he could help you get a first impression of the Integration API on DSM side.\n",
      "Would you mind inviting me and Ulrike to the Jive platform you are using?\n",
      "Please make sure you include Eric Irestone and Adam Johnson on any discussions you and Ulrike have surrounding authentication and data filtering based on roles via APIs as they will be involved in future development of UEM UI and the DSM APIs going forward.\n",
      "Ulrike and I talked today and we agreed to start deeper evaluation of this topic next week.\n",
      "We are seeing 3 main areas in this topic: 1) Authentication and 2) authorization as mentioned by Vince and additionally 3) find a way to handle the different Role and Right models to improve customer experience by giving the possibility to define DSM permissions from HEAT SM.\n",
      "Even if 3) is not yet a target for 2016.1 we probably need to discuss it to avoid going in the wrong direction and having subsequent efforts because of that. \n",
      "thank you for your quick response. Item 1) below would address ~80% of customers, so that’s good.\n",
      "DSM does not support other mechanisms than AD, internal ones as far as I know.\n",
      "Yes licensing is different. However, that is something which has to be solved not only for DSM but also for all other UEM products we have right now if they will be integrated to HEAT.\n",
      "Once we will have released DSM 2015.2.1 ;-) maybe Dietmar / Ulrike and you guys can have a discussion about that.\n",
      "@Vince, btw are you fine with the Use Cases for DSM/ITSM integration 2016.1?\n",
      "@Robert, I am still working on the use case document.\n",
      "The first one is Phase 1 – Basic Client Management capability which introduces a basic web based computer and software management capability as an HEAT application for the Client Management (CMT) solution (HEAT DSM):\n",
      "- As an administrator in charge of software management I can manage static group membership\n",
      "- Only groups having at least one policy assigned are shown up in the console to manage static group membership\n",
      "- As and admin I start searching for a computer. As I click it shrinks the results in the live list\n",
      "- When I click on the found endpoint it shows all the relevant details in a read only view grouped by prop groups known in DSMC\n",
      "- Having that client selected I am able to include or exclude static groups the client belongs to.\n",
      "The objective is to manage group membership. Therefore it is not a necessity to have tree control. The admin should be able to search for an endpoint an control membership of static groups.\n",
      "Not sure if we should include Lucy for UI design as well. Please let me know.\n",
      "In 2015.2.1 DSM integration, there is only one DSM account (usually DSM supervisor account) to authenticate and authorize access to DSM objects. We (Dietmar, JB, and I) have not had extensive discussion for DSM Web use cases. We do realize that we should have different approach for DSM Web use cases. I think there are 3 points that we should discuss:\n",
      "1) Single Sign-On: Both DSM and HEATSM supports Windows Integrated Security. If users exists on both systems and customer uses Windows Integrated security, users from both system can be authenticated. I believe most HEATSM and DSM on premise customers will use this method.\n",
      "2) Proprietary authentication: We should have discussion on which system is should be source of authentication. If customers are using both HEATSM and DSM and they are using internal authentication, they will probably like to use authentication credentials from HEATSM because it supports end users as well as help desk (I am assuming that customers will want to use authentication credentials from one system). \n",
      "3) Other authentication: HEAT support other authentication provider (LDAP authentication, SAML, Open ID). I am not sure whether DSM supports other authentication providers.\n",
      "- DSM should be source of truth for authorization. If a user is flagged as DSM Web (either by role or attribute of user record), DSM Web component should login to DSM using API and have access right controlled by DSM.\n",
      "- DSM and HEATSM use different licensing mechanism. Another complication is NTR Remote control. We should have further discussion on licensing.\n",
      "In DSMweb as it is today the admin logs in and the credentials controlled by the DSM business logic server set the appropriate rights and roles.\n",
      "A typical use case of DSM customers today is: they have let’s say 10 support guys being responsible for their endpoints. When they log into the DSM web console they see only the computers, groups, containers they are in charge of managing. The DSM API handles that already.\n",
      "What happens on the NEW dsm console on the HEAT platform if a logged in user/role connects from HSM to DSM through the API? How can we solve the issue having different credentials on the HSM side mapped to the DSM side. Or in other words, how can we make sure that several DSM admins can manage specific regions on the DSM side out of the HEAT platform? Any ideas?\n",
      "Today, setting up the HSM/DSM integration there is only one account accessing the DSM API which has to be set up in HSM (usually the DSM supervisor which would be a separate security discussion), or is that set per HSM login, per role, per tenant? Overall?\n",

I have a couple questions. We still have 2003 servers in our environment. I know that the 8.4 version of the agent no longer supports that OS. Is there a way to add a earlier version of the agent? There is still third party software on these that need to be updated. As far as scheduling the patch deployments, we have dependencies on startup and a few clusters in our environment. Is there an option to run command line scripts pre-deployment - for instance to move cluster resources or stop services? And is there an option to push the updates and then schedule the restarts? We have run into issues in the past where one server takes much longer than others during deploying patches so currently we have reverted back to just pushing patches and rebooting later when we can manage the startup sequence. I know one of your competitors has this ability directly from their console/configuration, but I have not seen that with Heat or just don't know where to do it. I have run into one other issue with deploying an agent. It is a 2008 server and the status shows online, but the PR shows as pending install. I have not figured out how to get it past that point so I can push patches to it.

Also, I found out that if you cut the ISO to a CD to boot your Absolute-issued E7450 then it should boot straight thru w/o asking for KillDisk’s registration name and key, but it will if you cut it and make a bootable USB Flash. Let me know if it should ask.\n",

      "Not sure if you have access to any WIPE utility that can do DoD 3-pass erase, but attached is the link to download our licensed, bootable ISO image of KillDisk for Windows and you can burn it to a CD or USB Flash Drive to boot up the Latitude laptop. Once in the Active KillDisk UI, check the entire drive or drives (if more than one physical drives), click Kill, and choose the US DoD 5220.22M (3 passes) in the Erase Method field. Please take a photo of the UI showing the disk killed and send us a copy.\n",

      "Thanks David. I’d believe that most likely we would present it as such to Absolute and see what they like us to do. If you have already manually wiped it and reloaded OS as a test machine, then I will mark it down as wiped, but this requires your confirmation. \n",
      " Subject: RE: Wiping your computers brought over from Absolute Software\n",
      "I have not been informed about how Absolute has setup and managed this device. Based upon this, I am highly scepticle on whether or not the device meets BOTH of those conditions, I assume that it doesn’t.\n",
      "Please advise how you would like to proceed under the assumption that it does NOT meet these conditions.\n",
      " Subject: RE: Wiping your computers brought over from Absolute Software\n",
      "We need your reply to confirm whether your Latitude laptop issued by Absolute meet the 2 conditions below. If it doesn’t then I’d suggest let’s not waste any more time but instead we will have to ask Absolute first to remove the agent in Absolute Customer Center account AND delete the device ID from their Computrace DB before we can even conduct wiping using Computrace\n",
      "In short, for any system issued by Absolute to be successfully wiped by HEAT using Computrace, the following 2 conditions must be met – \n",
      "1. The Computrace agent (aka DDS agent) on the system must have been disabled in Absolute CC (the Agent Removal Request can only be issued by Absolute IT since they put it onto your system originally).\n",
      "2. Anything that can identify your device (system serial #, Computrace Electronic Serial Number, etc.) must have been deleted out of the Computrace DB with Absolute (again this can only be done by Absolute IT or Support) \n",
      "If your system from Absolute does not meet both requirements above, the install of HEAT’s Computrace client would seem to go through but actually will have no effect because a background process RPCNET.EXE, a process required for Lojack software by Absolute, either will not run or still runs but points back to Absolute CC (installing client on top of existing active agent does not change the reporting route). \n",

Pam is rationalizing the SKUs to the HEAT process, and with the NetSuite consultant’s support this past week, those two are getting ready to load the SKUs into production, manually enter the reseller/end user customer record to process the order to invoice through NetSuite. There are still a few questions & requests that must be cleared first before those invoices can be sent out to the first Absolute customer:\n",
      "1) Absolute has been collecting orders for AS/AM/AM MDM since 6pm 10/2/15. They have approx. 30 orders they are ready to forward to us. The manager of order entry, Glen, said he is going to start forwarding the customer order and accompanying PO to Pam. We would like him to forward to a collection email box, can we get that setup by tomorrow am and can you provide to us what you’d like to name that email box– since this will be new customer/channel partner facing. (I believe that Absolute’s collection email box was called “OrderManagement” or something to that effect. Please provide the new email box name by tomorrow am. I am not totally tied to this solution, but like the idea of having something simple that external parties can email to a single collection spot. Pam would control that email box for data integrity and at the time being be the only one that can access it. Please work with me if you have questions on this.\n",
      "2) Absolute Order Entry team said there are about 15 active resellers that deal with several end customers. He said he will send us basic customer record info on those 15-20 active resellers tomorrow, so Pam and team can start working on these to enter to Netsuite.\n",
      "3) Glen is going to be sending a message to each customer/channel partner at the time he forwards the orders to Pam/new email box and let them know that their order will be serviced by HEAT going forward and we want to provide contact information for key areas – new orders, general questions, support, existing order questions, etc. Glen agreed that he can include our contact info – so we need to provide to him tomorrow am, as he was planning to start this tonight. But, we asked him to wait till tomorrow to coordinate on his communication letter.\n",
      "4) Also, Pam has an Absolute “Welcome” email that is sent to the customer along with the license key. She said it will be discussed in tomorrow’s Absolute product marketing meeting that needs to be updated for Heat. She will need something for tomorrow if possible so Pam can get the first few orders invoiced.\n",
      "5) To include with the invoice itself – a letter to customer or directly on the Absolute invoice itself – some kind of communication that explains why the invoice looks different, providing our vendor information to them, key contact info (support, questions, new orders, payments in USD, etc.).\n",
      "6) Not sure yet of the extent – but most likely many of the invoices were billed in foreign currency, we should know more once we receive the actual invoice data from Absolute. HEAT US policy is that we bill in USD.\n",
      "7) Question to Adrian mostly, or anyone else that might have read the agreements, are the POs from the Resellers (90% of the sales come from resellers, so the 10% direct customer is dotted in there) that Absolute is forwarding to us, is addressed to Absolute Software. Question is are all / some of the reseller/customer contracts assignable? We will need to get the agreements owned by heat as this will impact our rev rec. We can bill the customers, but that doesn’t mean we can recognize the revenue if we don’t have legal contracts in place.\n",

IA is currently delivered via two mechanisms: for customer environments with nodes >1000 Sales Engineering provides this service; for customer environment with nodes <1000 nodes, CAG resources in Luxembourg were delivering this service. The Luxembourg resources were let go with the office closure. As a result, no one in the company is delivering international IA services for those customers with <1000 nodes.\n",
      "2. Revenue is being deferred and cannot be recognized until the IA is delivered (impacts subscription + IA revenue and IA revenue alone when sold with licenses).\n",
      "3. We agree the IA function that was being performed by Sandy Bonali in LUX will transfer to your group, as IA is booked and recognized as PSO revenue.\n",
      "4. You are currently planning to move a sales engineer into your group to handle IA. You’ll need to evaluate if additional headcount will be required as this engineer will be delivering services for both those customers with >1000 nodes as well as <1000 nodes.\n",
      "5. The attached spreadsheet, prepared by Bev Watry, lists all known IA that is waiting for delivery in International (see second tab). This data is as of close of 2015 year. It does not include any new January bookings.\n",
      "6. You would like to know if someone can advise you who these IA tasks are assigned to, including both Sales Engineering as well as which ones belong to Sandy Bonali. By copy of this email to Pam, I’m asking if she can assist here.\n",
      "7. All new IA activity for <1000 nodes in International continues to be assigned to Sandy. As soon as you have a sales engineer in place, you will advise Pam to replace Sandy’s name with the engineer’s name.\n",
      "8. Meanwhile, Support will respond in a reactive mode to assist customers with IA requests. We have limited ability to do so and if multiple customers start making requests that their IA services be fulfilled, we’ll be unable to continue with this workaround.\n",

      "Based on existing routing rules, the leads I just imported for a LANRev webinar we had last week were assigned to partners.\n",
      "LANRev has been tricky as only specific people have been trained to follow up on these leads. I have not assigned Salesforce tasks or alerts as we are still updating lead assignment and then I will send out follow up emails and task assignments. In this situation we have leads from a third party webinar that has international leads so I'm looking for clarification as to who should be following up on these leads. Just to add another layer of complexity, the routing went to partners, however they haven't been assigned follow up so I'm asking you and Helen for guidance as obviously these partners don't know anything about this campaign.\n",
      "If we do not have direct reps to cover these leads, then yes, by all means let’s give them to partners.\n",

Many of the leads routed to various International SDRs and some went to a group called Blue Turtle Technologies and some went to Service Desk Solutions.

(for example, Many departments have access to SaaS assets like Support, SaaSOps, PSO, Dev, Sales, Training, finance, MSP, and even some executives all have different levels of access specifically to SaaS assets that are not integrated with IT systems) Because our systems are not necessarily integrated with IT to know when someone leaves, we need to verify that the former or changed employee has their rights changed/removed separate in assets like tenants/Cloud based apps, Servers, External Monitoring, cloud management tools and DBs.\n",
